          I am a Full Stack Web Developer from India. I enjoy creating scalable web applications and constantly
          interested in learning new technologies. Using Javascript, React, CSS,
          and HTML, I created clones of a few websites. I have developed
          excellent problem-solving skills that are required to solve complex
          problems. I have also solved maths problems to solve software
          engineering problems. I look forward to working as a responsible and
          competent employee in a tech company.
